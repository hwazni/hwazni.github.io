I am a Ph.D student under the supervision of Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh. I am currently based in University College London (UCL) within the Principles of Natural Language, Logic and Statistics research lab as well as the Principle of Programming Languages and Verification group.

My main research involves developing, implementing and evaluating compositional vector-based models of natural language semantics using methods from machine learning & quantum computing. Other research interests include multimodal representations across language, vision, & audio and their applications.
